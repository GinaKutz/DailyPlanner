# DailyPlanner

This task was challenging in that it was difficult to know where to begin. I do not understand JavaScript as intuitively as HTML and CSS so there was a bit of time where I was simply looking at the tasks and unsure where to begin. I did ask questions to my fellow students on how to begin the list of tasks for the JS code and that was helpful.
